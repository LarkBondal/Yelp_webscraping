# Yelp_webscraping 
# This is a Yelp web scraper done by scrapy to extract data to give the 
# user new local business (restaurants) that are on the rise, returning the 
# restaurant name, number of ratings, and how long ago it has been established.
# I also use the framework BeautifulSoup to simplify data to be readable.
